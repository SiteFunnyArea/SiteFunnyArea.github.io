        <h1>Getting User IDs</h1>
        <p>
            This bot doesn't support pinging users to add to your no-ping list.<br>
            To add users to your no-ping list, you have to use their User ID. This is how you get it.<br>
            <br>
            1. Go in to your User Settings.<br>
            2. Find "Advanced" in the sidebar of your user settings.<br>
            3. One of the options should say "Developer Mode". If it is disabled, enable it by clicking the checkbox next to the setting.<br>
            4. Exit your User Settings.<br>
            5. Either right-click the user you want to add to your list, or click of their user profile.<br>
            6. If you right-clicked, click Copy ID. If you clicked on their profile, click the three dots at the top right corner of their profile, and click "Copy ID".<br>
            <br><br>
            After you do this, you will have the persons User ID.
